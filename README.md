#Expanding, Collapse Cards.

Welcome to my image gallery project.

This Image gallery lets you browse through a collection of high quality pictures.
Each image is displayed on its own card and when you click on a card, it expands to show the 
full-size image. This makes it easy to focus on one image at a time.

To use the immage gallery, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. you can
then click on any of the image cards to enlarge it. To go back on the smaller cards,
just click on the enlarged image again.

The gallery was created Using Html,CSS, and javascript.
